# Preference-Based Taxi Dispatch

This project introduces:

- A novel matching algorithm that reduces passenger harassment risks.
- Multi-layer preference scoring (using ratings, fare, distance, etc.).
- Optimized taxi-passenger matches using stable matching principles.
- Simulation of the algorithm with a synthetic dataset.
