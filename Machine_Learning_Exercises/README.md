# Machine Learning Exercises

This folder contains coding exercises, focused on implementing the following ideas from scratch (without using conventional Python libraries):

- Image feature extraction
- Dimensionality reduction (MDS, PCA)
- Discriminant analysis (Fisher, Gaussian-based)
- One-class SVM for anomaly detection
- Canonical correlation analysis
- Kernel methods (weighted-degree, set-of-words)
- Building a simple neural network
- Interpreting VGG16 outputs via modified gradients
