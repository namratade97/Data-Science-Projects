# Interpretable Prediction of Molecular Atomization Energy

This project focuses on:

- Visualizing molecules and bonds between atoms in 3D space.
- Predicting atomization energy using Ridge Regression.
- Explaining predictions based on atom types, bond distances, and bond types.
- Creating interpretable molecule representations from atomic pairwise distances.
