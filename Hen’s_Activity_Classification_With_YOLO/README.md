# Henâ€™s Activity Classification with YOLO

This project uses a YOLOv8-based deep learning framework on custom video data to:

- Detect and classify hen behaviors from video frames (with hyper parameter optimisation to prevent the model from Overfitting) .
- Track activity patterns over time.

This implementation could further be used in optimizing space allocations and improve animal welfare in poultry farming.
