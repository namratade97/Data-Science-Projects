# Project Overviews:

This repository contains the following folders, each representing a distinct project:

- **`AI Excercises/`**
  - **Description**: This folder contains programming tasks in Artificial Intelligence, including implementations of simple reflex agents, constraint satisfaction problem solvers, depth-first search algorithms, minimax game-playing agents, Bayesian network inference, expected utility decision policies, and neural-network-based decision-making.

- **`Detecting and Explaining Anomalies and Cluster Analysis on Unsupervised Dataset/`**
  - **Description**: This is a task of calculating anomaly scores of data points with Hardmin and Softmin and explain the anomaly score with Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, understanding which features contribute most.

- **`Hen’s_Activity_Classification_With_YOLO/`**
  - **Description**: This project focuses on classifying and tracking the behavior of hens using the CNN based deep learning framework, YOLO(v8). This implementation could further be used in optimizing space allocations and improve animal welfare in poultry farming. 

- **`Interactive App for ML Model Training and EDA/`**
  - **Description**: This folder contains the application of an intercative dashboard aiming to provide insights into healthcare utilization among older Americans using the NPHA dataset. Users get an overview of the general trends in data, and choose to focus on parts of it with different visual aids. They can also train a customized Machine Learning model to predict the number of doctor visits and see how changing inputs of one parameter affects the model.

- **`Interpretable Prediction of Molecular Atomization Energy from 3D Geometry/`**
  - **Description**: In this project, we visualize multi-dimensional molecular data and identify bonds in 3D Space. We also use Ridge Regression to predict the atomization energy of the molecule and understand contribution of each atom. We also do a Molecule Representation based on Pairwise Distance between atoms and explain atomization energy as a function of both atomic bond distance and the bond type.

- **`Machine_Learning_Exercises/`**
  - **Description**: Contains programming tasks covering image feature representations, implementing several ML concepts from scratch, such as, dimensionality reduction (metric MDS, PCA via SVD and power iteration), discriminant analysis (Fisher and Gaussian-based), anomaly detection with one-class SVM, canonical correlation analysis for multi-modal data, kernel methods (weighted-degree and set-of-words), building a neural network, and interpreting VGG16 prediction via gradient modifications.
  
- **`Multi-Class Detection of Thoracic Anomalies in Chest Radiographs/`**
  - **Description**: This project is inspired by the AMIA challenge in Kaggle, where the aim is to use chest radiographs to identify and categorise thoracic anomalies. In this case, we have used a YOLO-based deep learning framework for the said task. We expect the model to identify abnormalities in images with a bounding box around each instance, and classify their respective types (including a ”No Finding” class, where the model does not recognize any abnormality in a given image).
    
- **`PTB Time Series/`**
  - **Description**: This project was in collaboration with PTB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt), where we tried to solve the problem of Energy price forecasting with data provided by PTB. We perform EDA and Feature Engineering on the dataset and explore multiple Time-Series models, as well as ML models to see which fits best. 

- **`Parkinson's_Disease_Prediction_From_Audio/`**
  - **Description**: This project features Parkinson’s Disease Prediction using live voice recording analysis with a Random Forest Regressor. The results are also integrated through a Flask application where users can record their voice and get the assessment in a web interface.

- **`Pixel Contribution Maps-Emphasizing Excitatory Effects in CNN/`**
  - **Description**: This features understanding and visualizing pixel-level contributions in CNNs for a Classification task. We also modify the layers of the neural network in a way so that we get the gradient which favors the excitatory effects keeping the output same as the original features model to robustify gradient-based explanations.

- **`Preference_Based_Taxi_Dispatch/`**
  - **Description**: This project proposed a novel method to reduce passenger harassment through optimized matching algorithms across multiple preference layers (such as ratings, distance, fare etc.) where each participating member is assigned a score before finding a match.
  
- **`Self Supervised Learning Excercises/`**
  - **Description**: This features implementation of several SSL and ML concepts from scratch, ranging from k-Means and backpropagation, to Autoencoders and PixelRNN.
  
- **`YOLOv5_Performance_Enhancement/`**
  - **Description**: This project enhances the original YOLOv5's class detection algorithm's performance, especially for video data. We have worked with a Fall detection dataset here. Where original YOLOv5 struggles with distinguishing between postures like 'Standing' and 'Walking' in each frame, produces flickering labels across frames, our modified algorithm overcomes the problem, and delivers stable, accurate posture classification throughout the video
