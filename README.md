# Project Overview

This repository contains the following folders, each representing a distinct project or exercise:

- **`AI Excercises/`**
  - **Description**: This folder contains short assignments in Artificial Intelligence, including implementations of simple reflex agents, constraint satisfaction problem solvers, depth-first search algorithms, minimax game-playing agents, Bayesian network inference, expected utility decision policies, and neural-network-based decision-making.

- **`Detecting and Explaining Anomalies and Cluster Analysis on Unsupervised Dataset/`**
  - **Description**: This is a task of calculating anomaly scores of data points with Hardmin and Softmin and explain the anomaly score with Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, understanding which features contribute most.

- **`Hen’s_Activity_Classification_With_YOLO/`**
  - **Description**: This project focuses on classifying and tracking the behavior of hens using the CNN based deep learning framework, YOLO(v8). This implementation could further be used in optimizing space allocations and improve animal welfare in poultry farming. 

- **`Interactive App for ML Model Training and EDA/`**
  - **Description**: This folder contains the application of an intercative dashboard aiming to provide insights into healthcare utilization among older Americans using the NPHA dataset. Users get an overview of the general trends in data, and choose to focus on parts of it with different visual aids. They can also train a customized Machine Learning model to predict the number of doctor visits and see how changing inputs of one parameter affects the model.

- **`Interpretable Prediction of Molecular Atomization Energy from 3D Geometry/`**
  - **Description**: In this project, we visualize multi-dimensional molecular data and identify bonds in 3D Space. We also use Ridge Regression to predict the atomization energy of the molecule and understand contribution of each atom. We also do a Molecule Representation based on Pairwise Distance between atoms and explain atomization energy as a function of both atomic bond distance and the bond type.

- **`Machine_Learning_Exercises/`**
  - **Description**: Contains assignments covering image feature representations, dimensionality reduction (metric MDS, PCA via SVD and power iteration), discriminant analysis (Fisher and Gaussian-based), anomaly detection with one-class SVM, canonical correlation analysis for multi-modal data, kernel methods (weighted-degree and set-of-words), building a neural network from scratch, and interpreting VGG16 prediction via gradient modifications.
  
- **`Multi-Class Detection of Thoracic Anomalies in Chest Radiographs/`**
  - **Description**: This project is inspired by the AMIA challenge in Kaggle, where the aim is to use chest radiographs to identify and categorise thoracic anomalies. In this case, we have used a YOLO-based deep learning framework for the said task. We expect the model to identify abnormalities in images with a bounding box around each instance, and classify their respective types (including a ”No Finding” class, where the model does not recognize any abnormality in a given image).
    
- **`PTB Time Series/`**
  - **Description**: _Energy price forecasting for PTB_
  - **Key Highlights**:
    - _E.g. Time-series decomposition, random forest regression, model evaluation_
  - **Technologies**: pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn

- **`Parkinson's_Disease_Prediction_From_Audio/`**
  - **Description**: _Voice‐based Parkinson’s detection_
  - **Key Highlights**:
    - _E.g. Feature extraction (jitter, shimmer), Flask web app, Praat integration_
  - **Technologies**: Python, Flask, Praat

- **`Pixel Contribution Maps-Emphasizing Excitatory Effects in CNN/`**
  - **Description**: _Visualization of pixel-level contributions in CNNs_
  - **Key Highlights**:
    - _E.g. Gradient‐based maps, excitatory vs. inhibitory analysis_
  - **Technologies**: PyTorch, Matplotlib

- **`Preference_Based_Taxi_Dispatch/`**
  - **Description**: _Optimizing taxi‐passenger matching with multi-layer preferences_
  - **Key Highlights**:
    - _E.g. Gale-Shapley matching, harassment risk reduction_
  - **Technologies**: Python, pandas, custom matching algorithms

- **`Self Supervised Learning Excercises/`**
  - **Description**: _Implementations of SSL techniques_
  - **Key Highlights**:
    - _E.g. Autoencoders, k-means, PixelRNN_
  - **Technologies**: PyTorch, NumPy

- **`YOLOv5_Performance_Enhancement/`**
  - **Description**: _Improving YOLOv5 detection in video streams_
  - **Key Highlights**:
    - _E.g. Temporal context integration, 60% accuracy boost for fall detection_
  - **Technologies**: PyTorch, OpenCV, YOLOv5
