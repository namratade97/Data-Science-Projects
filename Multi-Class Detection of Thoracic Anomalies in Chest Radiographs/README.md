# Multi-Class Detection of Thoracic Anomalies

This project, inspired by the AMIA Kaggle challenge, aims to:

- Detect and classify thoracic anomalies in chest X-rays.
- Use a YOLO-based model to predict multiple bounding boxes per image.

The primary focus is on medical image analysis using deep learning.
