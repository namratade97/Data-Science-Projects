# Detecting and Explaining Anomalies and Cluster Analysis

In this project:

- Anomaly scores are calculated using Hardmin and Softmin.
- Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) explains which features contribute most to the anomaly scores.
- Cluster analysis on the unsupervised dataset provides further insights.

The focus is on interpretability in anomaly detection.
